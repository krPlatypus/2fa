 * that turn — so two handlers in one popup can no longer interleave at all, and
 * a mutation never computes from a list it fetched before the previous write.
 *
 * Second, a revision counter for the contexts this queue cannot see. Every
 * write stamps one; a mutation records what it read and, if the stamp moved
 * under it, runs `apply` again on the fresh list. The mutations are all pure
 * functions of the list, so re-running is exactly re-deciding on current facts.
 * This is not a lock — chrome.storage offers no compare-and-swap — but it cuts
 * the window from "however long the user spent in the dialog" down to a single
 * storage round trip, and a write that still slips through is caught on the
 * next read rather than becoming permanent.
 *
 * The counter lives under its own key. 1.12.0 ignores keys it does not know, so
 * a browser rollback reads the account list exactly as before.
