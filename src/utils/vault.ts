// Lifecycle of the optional password-protected vault: creation, unlocking,
// auto-lock, password change and recovery.
//
// This module owns key material and vault metadata only. Encrypting the actual
// account records lives in storage.ts, which consumes getMasterKeyBytes() —
// keeping the dependency one-directional (crypto -> vault -> storage).
//
// Where the unlocked key lives, and why:
// MV3 evicts the service worker after ~30s idle and the popup is destroyed on
// every close, so a key held in JS memory would mean re-entering the password
// on every single click of the toolbar icon. chrome.storage.session is memory
// backed, never written to disk, cleared when the browser closes, and is not
// reachable from content scripts — which is exactly the lifetime we want. It
// is covered by the "storage" permission we already hold, so this costs no new
// permission (using chrome.alarms for auto-lock would have).
